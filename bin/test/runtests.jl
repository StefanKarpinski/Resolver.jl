# Regression tests for the `bin/` resolver tooling (bin/Registries.jl).
#
# Run from the repo root with the bin/ environment:
#
#     julia --project=bin bin/test/runtests.jl
#
# These are integration tests: they need the General registry installed and,
# on a cold cache, network access to fetch the list of released Julia versions
# (bin/julia_versions.json). They are intentionally *not* part of the package
# test suite (test/runtests.jl), which is offline and exercises only src/.

    # 1.10.8, so those stay correctly incompatible (a bundled stdlib version can
